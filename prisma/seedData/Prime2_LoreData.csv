Origins,Temple Grounds - Main Energy Controller,"It is told that the Luminoth were not born of Aether, but of the stars. In the early days, we roamed the greatness of the void, bathing in the glorious light of a thousand stars. We met a vast number of enlightened minds... the N'kren, the Ylla, and the Chozo among them. Each of them, we found, had claimed a homeworld and formed a deep bond with it. In time, we decided to do the same.",Origins mp2 Logbook 01.png,Luminoth Lore,History,Golden Age
Our Heritage,Temple Grounds - Transport to Agon Wastes,"Our search for a home took us through the cosmos. For many a great cycle we roamed, yet a place to call our own eluded us. In time, we began to despair, feeling the search was in vain. We considered remaining among the stars until a scout returned with news of a world unlike any other. When we beheld Aether for the first time, so great was her beauty that we forsook the stars forever to live upon her surface. From that day forth, the Luminoth were of Aether, our blessed paradise.",https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/metroidwiki/images/thumb/1/10/Our_Heritage_mp2_Logbook_01.png/70px-Our_Heritage_mp2_Logbook_01.png,Luminoth Lore,History,Golden Age
Paradise,Agon Wastes - Mining Plaza (NTSC version)/Agon Wastes - Agon Energy Controller (PAL/Trilogy version),"Aether was a fertile, aged world with bountiful fields and oceans. The native creatures were gentle compared to the other worlds we had encountered. We settled in a mountain region first, in cliffside dwellings. In time, we established settlements in the green forest of Torvus and in the fertile plains of Agon. A Great Temple was built between our three domains, a place of peace and a monument to our accomplishments. It was a time of harmony for our people.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Golden Age
Saving Aether,Agon Wastes - Agon Energy Controller (NTSC version)/Agon Wastes - Mining Plaza (PAL/Trilogy version),"Aether's planetary energy supply reached a critical stage. If left unchecked, the energy would expire, bringing an end to the world. Our greatest minds devised a way to preserve and regulate the remaining planetary energy - the Energy Controllers.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Golden Age
Light of Aether,Agon Wastes - Portal Terminal,"The main Energy Controller was built in the Great Temple: three sub-controllers were built in Torvus, Agon, and Sanctuary. They collected the energy of Aether, then radiated it over the world to all who needed it. In time we came to call this precious energy the Light of Aether"". It brought peace and prosperity to the Luminoth.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Golden Age
The Stellar Object,Agon Wastes - Mining Station B (NTSC version)/Agon Wastes - Mining Station A (PAL/Trilogy version),"By the time we detected the stellar object as it streaked toward our world, it was too late to stop it. We fired numerous weapons at it in a vain attempt to alter its trajectory. Nothing worked. Our efforts placed a great strain on the Energy Controllers, and weakened Aether. All we could do as the object drew closer was take shelter and wait. We gathered stores of food and water, reinforced the shielding on our dwellings, and spent the last hours in peace.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Golden Age
Cataclysm,Agon Wastes - Mining Station A (NTSC version)/Temple Grounds - Meeting Grounds (PAL/Trilogy version),"The starborne terror burnt through the heavens and struck Aether with and untold might. We all expected the world to shatter...but Aether held. There was great devastation, however. The green plains of Agon were scorched forever, and the forest of Torvus was engulfed and wracked by the sea. The skies burned for days, casting darkness over the land.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Dark Age
Age of Anxiety,Temple Grounds - Meeting Grounds (NTSC version)/Temple Grounds - Path of Eyes (PAL/Trilogy version) ,"In time, the roar of a wounded planet subsided. The air, though fouled, was breathable. Light made its way through the dark veil over our world. Slowly, we ventured out from the shelters of our home to see what remained of our paradise. What little comfort we gained by surviving was soon shattered. Half of the planet's energy had vanished from the Energy Controllers. Aether became violently unstable as a result. Of the stellar object which stuck our home, there was no sign.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Dark Age
The World Warped,Temple Grounds - Path of Eyes (NTSC version)/Torvus Bog - Torvus Energy Controller (PAL/Trilogy version) ,"Amidst this turmoil, we discovered many anomalies. Spacial disturbances appeared across the land. Object went into a state of dimensional flux, their atoms divided between Aether and...somewhere else. There was little time to ponder these strange happenings, for we had to deal with the devastation of our lands.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Dark Age
The Ing Attack,Torvus Bog - Path of Roots (NTSC version)/Torvus Bog - Underground Tunnel (PAL/Trilogy version),"The day came when space was torn asunder, revealing dimensional rifts to a dark place. Horrible dark swarms streaked forth from these rifts, engulfing nearby creatures and transforming them into what we could come to call darklings. The dark creatures became our enemies, and peace came to an end on Aether.",,Luminoth Lore,History,Dark Age
Dark Aether,Torvus Bog - Torvus Energy Controller (NTSC version)/Torvus Bog - Path of Roots (PAL/Trilogy),"In time, we created machines to open rifts to our enemy's world. Volunteer scouts went through the rifts and found a twisted world, harsh and poisonous...a Dark Aether. They discovered that this world held the missing half of our planet's energy. They also saw the true face of the enemy, a race we came to call ""Ing"", meaning terror. Our scouts could not survive long on the surface of Dark Aether, so venomous was its air. Still, we vowed to return. We prepared for war.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,First Phase
Our War Begins,Torvus Bog - Underground Tunnel (NTSC version)/Torvus Bog - Training Chamber (PAL/Trilogy version),"We developed Crystals that brought the Light of Aether to the dark world. Using these Crystals allowed our warriors to explore the enemy lands, to bring war to the Ing. Sadly, the Crystals were not enough. We needed stronger weapons, better armor. We withdrew from Dark Aether while our greatest minds devised new engines of war.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,First Phase
Recovering Energy,Torvus Bog - Training Chamber (NTSC version)/Torvus Bog - Catacombs (PAL/Trilogy version),"We were not prepared to fight a long war. The forces of the enemy outnumbered ours vastly. We sought a way to end the war quickly, without extended combat. We decided to build a device to recover our lost planetary energy from Dark Aether. Without this energy, the dark world would cease to be, and our world would be restored to stability.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,First Phase
New Weapons,Torvus Bog - Gathering Hall (NTSC version)/Agon Wastes - Mining Station B (PAL/Trilogy version),"Our studies of the Ing revealed the source of their attacks as dark energy. We built weapons to use this energy, thinking it could overload energy targets and eliminate them. We soon learned our error, as the Dark Beam was not of great effect on the Ing. We then began to develop a weapon that used light energy. This weapon would dispatch the Ing with terrible efficiency.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,First Phase
The New Terror,Torvus Bog - Catacombs (NTSC version)/Torvus Bog - Gathering Hall (PAL/Trilogy version),"In time, the Ing began to possess Luminoth as well as creatures. Friends and family members became the enemy, spilling Luminoth blood across the land. Desperate, we devised shielding to prevent Ing possession. It was effective, but not perfect. Should the shielding fail, all Luminoth were prepared to self-terminate rather than become a weapon for the Ing.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,First Phase
The Sky Temple,Temple Grounds - Fortress Transport Access,"We learned that the ruler of the Ing dwelled in a place dubbed the Sky Temple"" by our forces. This place held the planetary energy of Dark Aether as well. It was heavily guarded, and entry was barred by a great gate requiring ten keys to unlock. These keys were hidden throughout Dark Aether by the Ing. A mission was planned, one that would find the hidden keys and recover our missing energy from the Sky Temple.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,Second Phase
The Final Crusade,Sanctuary Fortress - Hall of Combat Mastery (NTSC version)/Sanctuary Fortress - Sanctuary Energy Controller (PAL/Trilogy version),"While our forces on Dark Aether fought desperate battles against superior numbers, our best minds completed their work. The Energy Transfer Module, a device designed to recover our lost planetary energy, was ready at last. A force of our greatest warriors was assembled, each equipped with the best armor and weaponry available. We sent this brave cadre of fighters to invade the Sky Temple and seize the missing energy lying within.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,Second Phase
Shattered Hope,Sanctuary Fortress - Main Research (NTSC version)/Sanctuary Fortress - Hall of Combat Mastery (PAL/Trilogy version),"None of the warriors sent to the Sky Temple returned. Our forces searched Dark Aether for them, in vain. Of the Energy Transfer Module, there was no sign. Though saddened, we set out to prepare another mission, to build another module, to try once more to save our dying world.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,Second Phase
Agon Falls,Sanctuary Fortress - Sanctuary Energy Controller (NTSC version)/Sanctuary Fortress - Main Gyro Chamber (PAL/Trilogy version),"A massive Ing attack came to the land of Agon. Soon, the Temple of Agon was surrounded by the Horde, with no hope of salvation. Our gallant warriors there were slain, and Agon fell to the enemy. Our blood chilled when we learned that the energy within that temple was drained. The Ing had found the Energy Transfer Module, and were using it as a weapon against us.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,Second Phase
Torvus Falls,Sanctuary Fortress - Main Gyro Chamber (NTSC version)/Sanctuary Fortress - Sanctuary Entrance (PAL/Trilogy version),"The Ing turned their focus on the Torvus Bog next, sending a vast force to lay siege to the temple there. Thousands upon thousands of Ing were destroyed by our warriors, yet they kept coming until there was no Luminoth alive to offer resistance in Torvus. On that day, the energy of Torvus was taken to Dark Aether, and our hopes for survival grew dim.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,Second Phase
Sanctuary Falls,Sanctuary Fortress - Watch Station (NTSC version)/Sanctuary Fortress - Main Research (PAL/Trilogy version),"Our battered forces gathered in the Sanctuary Fortress to prepare for the inevitable siege there. They didn't wait long. Wave after wave of Ing assaulted the greatest of our fortresses, with one goal in mind: to seize the energy there. The Ing turned the machines of Sanctuary against our warriors, and soon all was lost. The energy of Sanctuary was taken by the Ing. Only one Energy Controller remained on Aether.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,Final Phase
Twilight,Sanctuary Fortress - Sanctuary Entrance (NTSC version)/Sanctuary Fortress - Watch Station (PAL/Trilogy version),"What few remained gathered in the Great Temple. There, all but U-Mos, the last Sentinel of Aether, entered into life-preserving stasis. There they remain, to be released once the Ing were destroyed...or to sleep forever. His people safe, U-Mos prepared for the last, terrible assault. In the silence of the Great Temple, he prayed for salvation, for deliverance from the terror of the Ing.",,Luminoth Lore,Conflict,Final Phase

G-Sch's Testament,Torvus Bog - Catacombs,"What craven savages are the Ing! Trapped in the catacombs with no chance of rescue, I fought them to the last. I watched them feed upon their dead.

This ""Dark Aether"" has suffered a global calamity, turning it into a toxic wasteland. It is the homeworld of the shadowy creature who have been raiding our base for the last cycle.
