Origins,Temple Grounds - Main Energy Controller,"It is told that the Luminoth were not born of Aether, but of the stars. In the early days, we roamed the greatness of the void, bathing in the glorious light of a thousand stars. We met a vast number of enlightened minds... the N'kren, the Ylla, and the Chozo among them. Each of them, we found, had claimed a homeworld and formed a deep bond with it. In time, we decided to do the same.[100]",Origins mp2 Logbook 01.png,Luminoth Lore,History,Golden Age
Our Heritage,Temple Grounds - Transport to Agon Wastes,"Our search for a home took us through the cosmos. For many a great cycle we roamed, yet a place to call our own eluded us. In time, we began to despair, feeling the search was in vain. We considered remaining among the stars until a scout returned with news of a world unlike any other. When we beheld Aether for the first time, so great was her beauty that we forsook the stars forever to live upon her surface. From that day forth, the Luminoth were of Aether, our blessed paradise.[101]",https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/metroidwiki/images/thumb/1/10/Our_Heritage_mp2_Logbook_01.png/70px-Our_Heritage_mp2_Logbook_01.png,,,
Paradise,"Agon Wastes - Mining Plaza (NTSC version), Agon Wastes - Agon Energy Controller (PAL/Trilogy version)","Aether was a fertile, aged world with bountiful fields and oceans. The native creatures were gentle compared to the other worlds we had encountered. We settled in a mountain region first, in cliffside dwellings. In time, we established settlements in the green forest of Torvus and in the fertile plains of Agon. A Great Temple was built between our three domains, a place of peace and a monument to our accomplishments. It was a time of harmony for our people.[102]",,,,
Saving Aether,"Agon Wastes - Agon Energy Controller (NTSC version), Agon Wastes - Mining Plaza (PAL/Trilogy version)","Aether's planetary energy supply reached a critical stage. If left unchecked, the energy would expire, bringing an end to the world. Our greatest minds devised a way to preserve and regulate the remaining planetary energy - the Energy Controllers.[103]",,,,
Light of Aether,Agon Wastes - Portal Terminal,"The main Energy Controller was built in the Great Temple: three sub-controllers were built in Torvus, Agon, and Sanctuary. They collected the energy of Aether, then radiated it over the world to all who needed it. In time we came to call this precious energy the Light of Aether"". It brought peace and prosperity to the Luminoth.[104]",,,,
The Stellar Object,"Agon Wastes - Mining Station B (NTSC version), Agon Wastes - Mining Station A (PAL/Trilogy version)","By the time we detected the stellar object as it streaked toward our world, it was too late to stop it. We fired numerous weapons at it in a vain attempt to alter its trajectory. Nothing worked. Our efforts placed a great strain on the Energy Controllers, and weakened Aether. All we could do as the object drew closer was take shelter and wait. We gathered stores of food and water, reinforced the shielding on our dwellings, and spent the last hours in peace.[105]",,,,
