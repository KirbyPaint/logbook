"Leviathan Infant ","Phaaze - Genesis Chamber","Yes","Leviathans are the children of Phaaze. They are bioforms that begin life deep within the planet, inside the base of a serpentine organ that serves as a womb. The Leviathan will remain in here, feeding on an endless supply of Phazon, until it has developed its Phazon core. The developed core marks the Leviathan's transition into adolescence and its departure from the womb. The serpentine organ moves the adolescent from deep inside Phaaze and releases it closer to the planet's surface. Here the bioform will continue to grow and mature beneath its older siblings. As time passes and the older ones are launched into space, the Leviathan will slowly make its way to the planet's surface. It is here the Leviathan will reach full maturity. Once Phaaze has located a planetary target to corrupt, it will launch the Leviathan into space. The Leviathan is capable of interstellar travel, creating wormholes in space to expedite the journey. Instinctively, it homes in on its planetary target. Shortly after impact, the bioform dies, leaving its armored shell to protect the Phazon core. Before it dies, the bioform often attracts and enthralls a large local predator. After mutating it through intense Phazon exposure, it compels the creature to protect the core. The core then begins to seep into the planet, replacing the local ecosystem with one based on Phazon.","Morphology: Leviathan Infant. A Leviathan in early development. Phazon within is highly unstable.","Phazon",
"Liquid Phazon ","Norion, GFS Valhalla",,"Liquid Phazon appears to be a semisentient glob of Phazon.

Plasma-based beam weapons, attack claws, and a multimissile system are at the cyborg�s disposal in battle. These battle systems can be combined and fired at once as a devastating alpha strike. Target is also capable of a high-speed ramming attack, although this is potentially dangerous if performed over a slippery surface.","Morphology: Ghor. Shield repels all weapon fire. Powered by a unit on his back.","Bosses",
"Helios ","Elysia - Elysian Leviathan Core","Yes","Helios's exterior armor is well shielded, but still vulnerable to Beam weaponry. Inflicting enough damage will cause him to overheat and expose his Phazon-enhanced core. This core can be overloaded with Phazon-based energy. Destruction of the core unit should prove fatal, but is difficult to achieve. Target is the prime bot of a large group of Swarmbots, all of which have been energized by Phazon. Helios will use the Swarmbots for both offensive and defensive measures. Assuming different formations will allow for various forms of attack.","Mechanoid: Helios. Phazon-enhanced core can be exposed by damaging outer shell.","Bosses",
"Korakk Beast ","Bryyo - Jousting Field","Yes","Korakks are prized by the Space Pirates, who use them as cavalry mounts. Their belly is occasionally vulnerable, but guarded from all sides. Finding a way to get underneath it and attacking would be effective. Nerve ending in the tail can be stressed through grappling, but only when the tail is extended. The interior of a Korakk's mouth, as well as the tip of their tongue, contains sensitive nerve clusters. Attacking these points could temporarily incapacitate the creature. They can emit Phazon energy through their feet and tongue. The Phazite armor they wear will repel most damage.","Morphology: Korakk Beast. Tongue and mouth are sensitive: belly sometimes vulnerable from the ground.","Bosses",
"Meta Ridley ","Norion - Generator Shaft","Yes","Target's body is covered with incredibly durable armorskin, making it difficult to damage. All parts of the body are protected except for the mouth, where Meta Ridley fires his plasma-powered weaponry. Observing target may reveal additional target points. Target will use powerful plasma-based ranged attacks, along with potent melee strikes.","Morphology: Meta Ridley. Durable armorskin protects body. Fires plasma attacks from mouth.","Bosses",
"Metroid Hatcher ","Pirate Homeworld - Metroid Creche, Norion - Generator B, GFS Valhalla - Aurora Chamber","Yes","Mutation has robbed the Metroid Hatcher of its ability to phase, but has provided it a hardened outer shell which has identical attributes as Phazite. This shell protects the creature's heart, located at the core of its head. The Hatcher's tentacles are quite dangerous, and can even leech energy from any targets they connect to. However, the tentacles are also the creature's weak point. If all its tentacles are ripped from its body, it will perish. As such, it will attempt to recover energy by retracting them into its shell when they take damage. While the Hatcher's tentacles are retracted, it is unable to attack, relying on the Phazon Metroids it spawns from its mouth for protection. If the interior of the creature is hit while its mouth is open, it loses its strength. The Hatcher's tentacles can be ripped off if they are pulled at this time.","Morphology: Metroid Hatcher. When the head's interior is damaged, its tentacles can be ripped off.","Bosses",
"Mogenar ","Bryyo - Bryyo Leviathan Core","Yes","Corrupted War Golem reanimated and energized with Phazon. Relies on socketed energy orbs as a source of power. The orbs themselves have a fragile exterior but contain pure Phazon energy within. This energy must be completely overloaded before it will be destroyed. Eliminating all power sources is the only way to bring Mogenar offline.","Morphology: Mogenar. Ancient Reptilicus War Golem. Orbs appear to be source of power. Phazon Crystals are powering a protective barrier. An explosion near his feet could probably destroy them.","Bosses",
"Omega Ridley ","Pirate Homeworld - Pirate Homeworld Leviathan Core","Yes","Revived and regenerated through Phazon exposure, Omega Ridley has been energized to a new combat threat level. Target retains extremely durable, Phazon-enhanced armorskin, as well as protective armored plating. Scans indicate that a recent injury has not fully healed: expose and target wound to inflict damage. Target will act to protect this vulnerability: seek ways to stun the enemy and leave it open for deadly attacks.","Morphology: Omega Ridley. Armored plating protects body. Fires plasma attacks from mouth.","Bosses",
"Rundas ","Bryyo - Temple of Bryyo","Yes","Phazon exposure has greatly enhanced Rundas and his ability to generate ice, making him deadly at any range. His durable ice armor has one weak point--the neck. Serious physical stress can weaken and remove it, exposing Rundas to attack. This weak point cannot be seized as long as Rundas is active. He can create frozen objects at will, and can freeze Missiles in midflight. Smaller ice-based projectiles can be shot down, but it is recommended to evaded larger attacks. Be advised: Rundas can trigger a Hypermode state, elevating his threat level to match your own.","Morphology: Rundas. Ice armor protects body, but could be ripped off if he was stunned. Rundas is temporarily stunned. Ice armor can now be ripped off if pulled with enough force.","Bosses",
"Steamlord ","SkyTown - Hub Access, Barracks Access, Steambot Barracks, Skybridge Hera, Ballista Storage","Yes","Steamlords command the worker drones of SkyTown. They also repair them when they malfunction or break down. Lightly armored, they rely on their cloaking field to evade their enemies. They will only uncloak to attack or repair fallen Steambots, but can still be detected with an advanced visor system while hidden. They can generate localized EMP fields to hinder enemy visor systems.","Mechanoid: Steamlord. Repairs fallen Steambots. Able to disrupt visor tech. Capable of cloaking itself.","Bosses","Log entry compiled from Original and Trilogy version"
"Advanced Aerotrooper ","SkyTown - Chozo Observatory, Pirate Homeworld - Transit Station 0203","Yes","When the going gets tough, the tough put on armor. Advanced Aerotroopers wear an extra layer of ablative armor that is susceptible to explosive blasts. Like regular Aerotroopers, they wield Twin Remote Attack Pods in combat. These are outfitted with a Particle Cannon and a Gel Bomb Rack. Gel Bombs stick to their targets until detonation. High-velocity movement can remove Gel Bombs.","Morphology: Advanced Aerotrooper. Armor resists Beam attacks. Vulnerable to explosive blasts.","Space Pirate",
"Advanced Pirate Trooper ","Bryyo - Temple of Bryyo, Ancient Courtyard, Jousting Field, Pirate Homeworld - Transit Station 0204, Transit Station 0205","Yes","Advanced Pirate Troopers wear an additional layer of ablative armor. Explosive attacks are recommended to break the armor away. Basic armament includes an assault rifle and energy scythe, both powered by Phazon. EMP grenades are often employed against power-armored foes. A new Dash Jet system provides increased mobility.","Morphology: Advanced Pirate Trooper. Armor resistant to Beam attacks. Vulnerable to explosive blasts.","Space Pirate",
"Advanced Shield Trooper ","Bryyo - Temple of Bryyo, Pirate Homeworld - Transit Station 0204","Yes","Advanced Shield Troopers wear an extra layer of ablative armor: it is susceptible to explosive attacks. In addition to their armor, they wield a portable battle shield. While the shield provides excellent protecting against incoming fire, it can also be easily ripped off. Phazon-based attacks are capable of destroying the shield.","Morphology: Advanced Shield Trooper. Battle shield deflects attacks, but can be pulled with Grapple Beam.","Space Pirate",
"Aeromine ","GFS Olympus - Repair Bay Shaft, Norion - Cargo Hub, Maintenance Station, Bryyo, SkyTown","Yes","Aeromines suffer from a design flaw--their shield- and beam-weapon units use the same power source, allowing only one to function at a time. This exposes the unit to damage when it fires at enemies. Aeromines were originally designed to take the role of sentry for Space Pirates, but have since been put to use in combat as well. Because of the initial design flaw, these units do not pose much of a threat. After the executions of the first design team, the new pirate designers swore to correct this flaw with great haste.","Mechanoid: Aeromine. Flying antipersonnel unit. Drops shield to fire weaponry.","Space Pirate",
"Aerotrooper ","Norion, Bryyo, SkyTown - Spire","Yes","Aerotroopers are dangerous foes, but their lack of armor leaves them vulnerable to explosive blasts. A weakness also lies in the jet pack: igniting it will allow the pack to be separated from the pilot. They use twin Remote Attack Pods to engage targets. The Attack Pods are capable of using a Particle Cannon or a Helix Missile Pod. They can tap their Phazon power unit to warp from point to point.","Morphology: Aerotrooper. Jet pack provides aerial mobility. Homing attacks recommended.","Space Pirate",
"Armored Aerotrooper ","Brryo, SkyTown - Zipline Station Delta","Yes","Armored Aerotroopers are deployed in harsh combat zones. Their armor is resilient, but susceptible to explosive blasts. In battle they use twin Remote Attack Pods to engage targets. They are equipped with a Particle Cannon and a Helix Missile Pod. They can tap their Phazon power unit to warp from point to point. A weakness lies in the jet pack: ignite and separate it from the pilot to neutralize the target.","Morphology: Armored Aerotrooper. Covered with a thin layer of armor. Susceptible to explosive attacks.","Space Pirate",
"Armored Pirate Militia ","GFS Olympus, Pirate Homeworld","Yes","Members of the Armored Pirate Militia have been granted lightweight armorsuits for combat use. While this provides some additional resistance to Beam weapons, they are still vulnerable to explosive attacks. Members of the Armored Pirate Militia are mostly inept soldiers who have yet to die in combat.","Morphology: Armored Pirate Militia. Expendable armored infantry units. Susceptible to explosive attacks.","Space Pirate",
"Armored Pirate Trooper ","Bryyo, SkyTown, Pirate Homeworld","Yes","Armored Pirate Troopers are equipped with a standard armorsuit. It provides adequate protection against Beam attacks but is vulnerable to explosive blasts. They are outfitted with all the basic pirate armaments. This includes the assault rifle and energy scythe, both powered by Phazon. EMP grenades are often employed against power-armored foes. A new Dash Jet system provides increased mobility.","Morphology: Armored Pirate Trooper. Covered with a thin layer of armor. Susceptible to explosive attacks.","Space Pirate",
"Armored Shield Trooper ","SkyTown - Spire, Pirate Homeworld - Transit Station 0204","Yes","Armored Shield Troopers are equipped with a standard armorsuit.

"Assault Aerotrooper ","Pirate Homeworld - Craneyard","Yes","Only the best can join the ranks of the Assault Aerotroopers. Heavily armored, they are resistant to most weapon systems. Their unique armor is able to deflect all Missile attacks, but can still be damaged by Beam weapons. Like regular Aerotroopers, they wield two Remote Attack Pods in combat. One is equipped with a Particle Cannon, the other with a Gel Bomb Rack. Gel Bombs stick to their targets until detonation. High-velocity movement can remove Gel Bombs.","Morphology: Assault Aerotrooper. Armor deflects Missile attacks. Vulnerable to Beam weapons.","Space Pirate",
"Assault Pirate Trooper ","Bryyo - Ancient Courtyard, Pirate Homeworld","Yes","The Assault Pirate Troopers are some of the best the pirate military has to offer. They are heavily armored and are resistant to most attacks. Their unique armor will deflect all Missile fire, but is still damaged by Beam attacks.

A new Dash Jet system provides increased mobility.","Morphology: Assault Pirate Trooper. Armor deflects Missile attacks. Vulnerable to Beam weapons.","Space Pirate",
"Assault Shield Trooper ","Pirate Homeworld","Yes","Assault Shield Troopers are heavily armored and resistant to most weapon systems. Their unique armor will deflect Missile attacks, but not Beam fire. In addition to their armor, they wield a portable battle shield. Their battle shield provides protection against all standard weapon fire, but can be easily torn off. Phazon-based weapons are capable of destroying the shield.","Morphology: Assault Shield Trooper. Battle shield deflects attacks, but can be pulled with Grapple Beam.","Space Pirate",
"Berserker Knight ","Bryyo - Ancient Courtyard, Pirate Homeworld - Transit Station 0205","Yes","A Berserker Knight's Phazite armor must be removed before unit can be damaged: only the Phazon-based projectile attacks the creature fires can destroy it. The Berserker Knight serves as a shocking example of the lengths the Space Pirates will go to in their quest for dominance. Heavily mutated by Phazon exposure, the unit is nearly mindless, driven by battle lust.","Morphology: Berserker Knight. Phazite plating can be destroyed by the same Phazon attacks it fires.","Space Pirate",
"Commando Pirate ","Pirate Homeworld",,"Commando Pirates use the best gear available: only Beams of the highest temperature can penetrate the layer of Phazite in the armorsuit. All of the weaponry is powered by Phazon. Each commando has a combat cloaking field, along with boost thrusters and a personal teleporter. The Phazite armor they wear makes them extremely resistant to damage in combat.","Morphology: Commando Pirate. Assault armor composed of Phazite. Able to cloak and teleport.","Space Pirate",
"Crawlmine ","GFS Olympus - Xenoresearch Lab, Norion - Conduit A, Conduit C, Pirate Homeworld - Phazon Mine Entry",,"Crawlmines are not terribly bright and rely on suicide strikes as their main form of attack. They were designed to patrol small areas such as ventilation shafts and maintenance tunnels. Though relatively harmless alone, they can be dangerous in large numbers.","Mechanoid: Crawlmine. Mobile explosive drone. Detonates on contact.","Space Pirate",
"Crawltank ","GFS Olympus, Norion, Bryyo, SkyTown, Pirate Homeworld",,"Crawltanks are mobile, ground-based defense drones, but are easily destroyed by standard weapon fire. They can be equipped with different cannons, including a Phazon Beam system. They are not built for sustained combat, and are better suited for light patrol and security roles.","Mechanoid: Crawltank. Small, mobile weapon platform. Lightly armored, well armed.","Space Pirate",
"Despair-Class Turret ","Pirate Homeworld - Does not appear in the original NTSC version.","Yes","The Space Pirates have upgraded the venerable ""Remorse"" turret with a new unit. The ""Despair"" turret has been reinforced with a layer of heavy armor, making it far more durable. The unit's offensive capabilities remain identical to the previous model and fast moving targets are still able to avoid its limited targeting system.","Mechanism: Despair-Class Turret. Space Pirate defense system. Susceptible to explosive attacks.","Space Pirate",
"""Jolly Roger"" Drone","(Norion, Bryyo, SkyTown - Spire, Pirate Homeworld",,"The 'Jolly Roger' Drone is designed for quick aerial maneuvers, but this comes at the cost of survivability. The fragile armor of the unit is vulnerable to weapon fire of any type. The Jolly Roger is based on Federation tech, but has been considerably upgraded. Powered by Phazon, the mechanoid can be a serious threat in battle, especially in groups.","Mechanoid: Jolly Roger Drone. Fast and fragile aerial drone. Fires bursts of Phazon energy.","Space Pirate",
"Jumpmine ","Norion - Conduit A, Conduit C, Bryyo - Main Lift, Generator Hall North, SkyTown - Observatory Lift, Pirate Homeworld - Transit Tunnel P69","Yes","The Jumpmine was developed by the Space Pirates as a cheap alternative to an armed trooper. The Jumpmine scans its surroundings until it detects an enemy target. It then triggers a small thruster, 'jumping' a set distance in the air. Once launched, its weapon pod is engaged, saturating the local area with fire. It explodes afterward to prevent use by enemy forces.","Mechanoid: Jumpmine. Antipersonnel unit. Rises in air and explodes once engaged.","Space Pirate",
"Phazon Harvester Drone ","Pirate Homeworld - Phazon Harvesting","Yes","Man-portable weaponry cannot penetrate the thick hull of the Phazon Harvester. The anti-air weapon system is vulnerable but overloading it with weapon fire will only disable the drone temporarily. The pirates converted several Goliath-class heavy assault drones into Phazon-collecting units. The drone can use its Harvesting Beam Cannon for defense, and is equipped with an anti-aircraft missile defense system.","Mechanoid: Phazon Harvester Drone. Anti-air system cannot be destroyed, but overloading it will stun the drone.","Space Pirate",
"Pirate Cargo Drone ","Pirate Homeworld",,"Pirate Cargo Drones were designed to assist with the transporting of supplies throughout the Pirate Homeworld. Their aerial capabilities allow them to navigate the underground catacombs with relative ease. Cargo usually consists of items too dangerous or volatile to be moved by hand.","Mechanoid: Pirate Cargo Drone. Mechanical drone used by pirates for transporting various supplies.","Space Pirate",
"Pirate Commander ","Pirate Homeworld - Transit Station Leviathan","Yes","Commanders make heavy use of their personal teleporter, moving to favorable positions and across the battlefield, giving orders and support as needed. They carry all of the weaponry and gear used by commandos, with the exception of their armor, which is forged out of ultrarare Red Phazite. A rare breed, Pirate Commanders have lived to rise to the ruling caste on the Pirate Homeworld. Each has been a commando for at least ten years.","Morphology: Pirate Commander. Wears red Phazite assault armor. Resistant to most weaponry.","Space Pirate",
"Pirate Hussar ","Bryyo - Jousting Field","Yes","Hussars are unusually brave for Space Pirates, willing to ride the deadly Korakk beast into combat.

Rider of the vicious Korakk. Wields Energy Lance in combat.","Space Pirate",
"Pirate Militia ","GFS Olympus, Norion, Bryyo, SkyTown","Yes","The pirates have not enhanced all of their fighting forces. They continue to use militia units in battle. These groups are made up of slaves and criminals, and do not receive the Phazon enhancements given to regular army troopers.

Susceptible to missile attacks.","Space Pirate",
"Scritter ","Pirate Homeworld - Courtyard Passage, Pirate Seed - Landing Site Delta",,"Scritters are common vermin that are usually found underground. They tend to nest in dark places and come out only to feed. Their main source of sustenance is Phazon, a weakness pirate slaves use against them. Scritters will often be caught in simple traps set out by the starving pirate slaves who then feed on the small creatures. But the pirates rarely have the last laugh, as some internal organs of the Scritter will release a toxic fluid when bitten. Those who become violently ill because of this are often said to have a case of ""the scritters"".","Morphology: Scritter. Phazon-feeding vermin that usually travel in large groups.","Space Pirate",
"Shield Pirate Militia ","Norion, Bryyo","Yes","Some members of the Pirate Militia have been granted use of regular army-trooper equipment. This unit has been given the portable battle shield.

"Space Pirate Assault Skiff ","SkyTown - Spire","Yes","The fast moving Space Pirate Assault Skiff is used to support troops in combat. The skiff is mounted with a tribeam cannon, which is capable of firing powerful charged shots. However, the cannon itself is unprotected and can be easily overloaded. This modified version of the ATC has sacrificed durability for speed, and often employs hit-and-run tactics.","Vehicle: Space Pirate Assault Skiff. Lightly armored assault craft. Cannon appears vulnerable.","Space Pirate",
"Space Pirate ATC ","Norion - Cargo Dock A, Bryyo, SkyTown","Yes","The Space Pirate Armored Tactical Carrier (ATC) is surprisingly well built and armored. A forward-mounted heat vent is its only vulnerable spot. Tribeam cannons help the unit deal out damage while on missions as well.

It has a relatively small fuel supply, a sacrifice made for heavier armament and armor.","Vehicle: Space Pirate ATC. Well-armored transport. Forward vent is vulnerable.","Space Pirate",
"Space Pirate Boarding Pod ","GFS Olympus - Port Observation Deck, Xenoresearch Lab, GFS Valhalla - Weapons Cache",,"Pirate boarding pods are crude, even by their standards. They are composed of an aged propulsion drive, a cramped crew-transport module, and a nose cone packed with high explosives. The pilot guides the pod toward the target ship, then rams it, detonating the explosives upon impact in an attempt to breach the hull. If a breach is created, the crew within exits the pod. Of course, mishaps occur. Sometimes the explosives go off prematurely, exposing the crew to vacuum. Other times the detonation fails to occur, leaving the pod to bounce off the target's hull. The shielding between explosives and crew is substandard, and often fails to protect the crew from the explosion. The pod's nickname of ""Space Coffin"" is well earned.","Vehicle: Space Pirate Boarding Pod. These light craft are used to pierce the bulkheads of larger ships.","Space Pirate",
"Urtragian Shriekbat ","Pirate Homeworld - Scrapvault",,"Urtragian Shriekbats are fiercely territorial insectoids and will dive-bomb anything that wanders near.
