Light Beacon,Dark Agon Wastes - Portal Site,"Light Beacons must be energized by Beam weapon fire to function, and remain charged for a limited time. The Beacons were created when the Luminoth ran short of Light Crystals during the war. While simpler to make, the Beacons were also unstable. They had to be energized periodically, and could run out of energy at critical moments. Still, any protection was better than none for the Luminoth warriors.",No,,Light Beacon.png,Light Beacons,Lift Crystals,
Nullified Beacon,Dark Agon Wastes - Doomed Entry,"Light Beacons, when covered with dark energy, cease to function for a brief time. Light energy can clear the Beacon of the dark energy.
