A scythe-like appendage on its tip is honed to lethal sharpness. The Reaper Vine will swing this blade wildly at anything that enters its zone of perception.","No","Found throughout Chozo Ruins"
"Stone Toad","Chozo Ruins - Energy Core","The Stone Toad preys on creatures smaller than itself, and is vulnerable only from within. A Stone Toad is able to remain still for days, then it quickly swallows its prey whole. Anything it finds indigestible, it regurgitates. As a last resort, a Stone Toad will use its tusks in combat. A Stone Toad has a bulbous body and large green eyes. A rock-hard exoskeleton allows it to sit motionless for long periods of time.","No","Found throughout Chozo Ruins"
"Plated Parasite","Chozo Ruins - Furnace","Hardy member of the Parasite family. Invulnerable to most weaponry. A cousin to the Parasite, these creatures are known for their amazing resilience. Field studies suggest a weakness to Morph Ball-delivered weapon systems.","No","Also in Magmoor Caverns"
"Oculus","Chozo Ruins - Sun Tower","Wall-crawler that generates electrical pulses. The Oculus exposes its single eye when active. The electrical field that covers it is enough to deter most predators. If the Oculus detects anything capable of presenting a real threat, it retracts into its impermeable shell.","No","Has various locations"
"Plated Puffer","Chozo Ruins - Tower of Light","Mutated Puffer with reinforced epidermis. Phazon exposure has created a mutant strain of Puffers on Tallon IV. They have developed plated skin, making them harder to burst. Concussive weapons can still do the job, however. The gas within the Plated Puffer is just as deadly as that within their 'cousins'.","No","Has one location"
"Hive Mecha","Chozo Ruins - Hive Totem","Security unit programmed to work with predatory hive dwellers. A design flaw makes the shielding on Hive Mecha weak around their access ports. These units are second-generation combat drones, able to interface with organic units at a higher level. They train, shelter, and work with hive-dwelling predators. Unarmed, they rely on their hive beasts to handle any threats.","Yes","Must be scanned during battle."
"Incinerator Drone","Chozo Ruins - Burn Dome","Incinerator Drone, programmed for high temperature waste disposal. Device schematics indicate a high risk of malfunction when internal power core is damaged. Unit has minimal combat programming, but can defend itself if necessary. This drone’s intense heat blasts compensate for its lack of battle prowess.","Yes","Must be scanned during battle."
"Chozo Ghost","Chozo Ruins - Hall of the Elders","Spectral entity. Bioelectric field invulnerable to natural energies. As these entities phase in and out of existence, the only reliable way to track them accurately is with x-ray scanning. This partially phased nature makes them invulnerable to natural energy types, such as fire, ice, and electricity. Their aggressive and erratic behavior is most likely due to the corrupting effects of Phazon in the Tallon IV environment. They appear to be drawn to Chozo religious sites, where they wreak havoc upon anything that dares enter the area.","No","Can be found in a number or rooms and the Life Grove"
"Grizby","Magmoor Caverns - Burning Trail","Morphology: Grizby Subvolcanic carrion feeder. Carapace can be breached by Missiles. The Grizby's carapace has been fused together by superheated air. This barrier stands up to everything but concussive blasts. Its intelligence is limited to instinctive scavenging patterns.","No","Found in only one room"
"Burrower","Magmoor Caverns - Lake Tunnel","A tunneling insect predator, the Burrower is similar to the beetle, though it prefers to spend more time underground. It seeks seismic disturbances, then surfaces to attack. It has enough cunning to realize when something is too large for it to handle. Beyond that, it is fairly ignorant. What it lacks in brains, it makes up for in aggression.","No","Also can be found in the Phazon Mines"
"Puffer","Magmoor Caverns - Lava Lake","Unstable gas-filled organism. Will rupture on contact. Puffers fill their bodies with lethal meta-viprium gas and float about in search of food.
