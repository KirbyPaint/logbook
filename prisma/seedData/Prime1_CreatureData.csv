As these entities phase in and out of existence, the only reliable way to track them accurately is with x-ray scanning. This partially phased nature makes them invulnerable to natural energy types, such as fire, ice, and electricity. Their aggressive and erratic behavior is most likely due to the corrupting effects of Phazon in the Tallon IV environment. They appear to be drawn to Chozo religious sites, where they wreak havoc upon anything that dares enter the area.[28]","No","Can be found in a number or rooms and the Life Grove"
"Grizby","Magmoor Caverns - Burning Trail","Morphology: Grizby Subvolcanic carrion feeder. Carapace can be breached by Missiles. The Grizby's carapace has been fused together by superheated air.
